    "b1": "Blockchain is a shared database. The data or information stored in it has the characteristics of unforgeability, traceability, traceability, openness and transparency, and collective maintenance. Blockchain can be understood as a shared , an immutable electronic ledger that records transactions and tracks assets across the network. Assets here can be tangible (such as homes and cars) or intangible (such as intellectual property, patents, and brands). Almost anything of value Everything can be tracked and traded on the blockchain network, thereby reducing risks and costs in all aspects. At present, the biggest application of blockchain technology is digital currency, because the essence of payment is to 'increase the amount reduced in account A' into account B'. If people have a public ledger that records all transactions of all accounts so far, then for any account, people can calculate the amount of money it currently has. And the blockchain is precisely used for A public ledger for this purpose, which keeps all transaction records. The blockchain originated from Bitcoin, and on November 1, 2008, a person calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto published 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer' The article 'Electronic Cash System' expounds the framework concept of the electronic cash system based on P2P network technology, encryption technology, timestamp technology, blockchain technology, etc., which marks the birth of Bitcoin. Two months later, the theory entered into practice , the first genesis block with serial number 0 was born on January 3, 2009. A block with serial number 1 appeared a few days later on January 9, 2009, and was connected with the genesis block with serial number 0 to form It marks the birth of the blockchain.",
    "b2": "Compared to centralized wallets (exchanges) whose private keys are in the hands of third-party service providers, the private keys of decentralized wallets are kept by users themselves, and the assets are stored on the blockchain, and the users are real Holders of digital currency, wallets are just a tool to help users manage assets on the chain and read blockchain data, so they cannot control, steal, and transfer your assets. Therefore, decentralized wallets are difficult to be centralized by hackers Users don’t have to worry about the wallet service provider’s self-stealing or running away, because as long as you keep your private key when you create a wallet, your assets are still on the chain and can be displayed by changing wallets. Note: Decentralization Once the wallet is lost or stolen, it cannot be retrieved without backing up the private key or mnemonic, so be sure to back up your private key safely and correctly.",
    "b3": "Private key The private key is a 64-bit hexadecimal string composed of letters and numbers. After creating the wallet, enter the password to export the private key. An account has only one private key and cannot be modified. Usually, the private key and the public key appear in pairs in a wallet. With the private key, the public key can be generated through a certain algorithm, and then the address can be generated through a certain algorithm through the public key. This process is irreversible. On any wallet , by importing the private key and setting a new password, the assets of the previous A wallet can be imported into the B wallet. For example, if the mobile phone is lost, the assets can be recovered by simply importing the private key. The appearance of the mnemonic is due to the private key. It is composed of 64-bit strings, which is inconvenient to record and easy to copy. In order to facilitate the user's memory and recording, it is simplified into a mnemonic composed of 12 words, with a space between each word. The mnemonic and the private key have the same function, that is, as long as you enter the mnemonic phrase and set a new password, you can import the wallet. Like the private key, a wallet has only one set of mnemonic phrases and cannot be modified. The wallet password needs to be set when BitCooo creates a wallet , requires no less than 8 characters. The wallet password is mainly used to manage the wallet. For example, you need to enter the password when transferring money; when importing the wallet with the private key/mnemonic, you must enter the wallet password. The password can be modified or reset. If the original If you forget the password, you can use the private key or mnemonic to import the wallet, and set a new password at the same time. You can compare it with a bank account to distinguish: Private key = bank card number + bank card password mnemonic = bank card number + bank card password =Bank card password",
    "b4": "As the name suggests, Gas Fee is the fee paid to the miners. When you transfer money on the blockchain, the miner needs to package your transfer transaction and put it on the blockchain to complete the transaction. , in this process, the computing resources of the blockchain will be consumed, so miner fees will be generated. Price (unit price) and consumed Gas Limit (quantity) are determined, and the calculation formula is as follows: Miner fee = Gas Limit * Gas Price Gas Limit The quantity is mainly affected by the complexity of the operation according to the content of the smart contract. The more operations, the higher the Gas limit. The Gas Price is set by the initiator. The higher the Gas Price set by the initiator, the faster the transaction can be initiated. It is packaged. Note: The gas fee for ETH is ETH; the gas fee for BSC is BNB; the gas fee for HECO is HT; the gas fee for OKExChain is OKT;",
    "b5": "A smart contract is composed of an address and the code stored corresponding to the address. For example, sending an ERC20 Token on Ethereum essentially creates a smart contract for a Token, and the code of the smart contract determines the address. All the contents of the Token in it. Since the smart contract does not have a private key, once it is transferred to the contract address, it may never be transferred out again. (Some contracts have reserved codes that can transfer the Token, and some people think that this is an anonymous project. The 'back door' deliberately left by the party has hidden dangers.) Therefore, when transferring or withdrawing Token from the exchange, do not directly transfer to the contract address of the Token.",
    "b6": "With the development of public chains, exchanges are also launching their own public chains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) launched by Binance, Huobi Ecological Chain (HECO) launched by Huobi, OKEx launched OKExChain, etc. Due to the increasing demand for cross-chains, the same asset will appear on different public chains. For example, USDT can be circulated in ETH, TRX, BSC, HECO, etc., but they are not completely consistent, nor It is possible to transfer money directly to each other, and the address formats of ETH, BSC, HECO and OKExChain are all the same, so users often make transfer or withdrawal errors. Note: 1. Direct transfers between different public chains are not allowed, such as on Ethereum. The USDT cannot be directly transferred to HECO. 2. When withdrawing money from an exchange, pay attention to choosing a withdrawal channel/public chain. For example, if you want to withdraw money from Binance to Binance Smart Chain, you must choose BEP20 or BSC channel; To withdraw coins from Huobi to the Huobi Ecological Chain, you must choose the HECO channel, otherwise the account will not be received. What should I do if I withdraw to the wrong channel or transfer to the wrong chain? 1. If the direct transfer is wrong, for example, in the wallet directly from Ethereum transfers USDT to BSC wallet. In this case, the BSC wallet will definitely not receive the account, so you only need to import the private key corresponding to the BSC wallet to Ethereum, and you can see USDT appear. (If you look at If you don’t have USDT, you can manually add tokens) 2. The exchange has withdrawn the wrong channel. For example, if you want to withdraw USDT to HECO, but forgot to select the channel or chose the wrong channel to Ethereum, then you only need to send your The private key corresponding to the wallet on the HECO can be imported into Ethereum, and you can see that USDT appears. (If you can't see USDT, you can manually add tokens)",
    "b7": "When a transfer transaction shows that the transfer fails on BitCooo, it is usually caused by the following three reasons: 1.Out of gas (insufficient gas fee) 2.Bad instruction (instruction error) 3.Reverted ( Return) If a transfer fails, BitCooo will not deduct your assets, just return to the wallet [Assets] page to check. It should be noted that the miner fee generated by this transfer will not be refunded. It's not that BitCooo 'takes up' your miner's fee, but because the transaction has been packaged by the miner, the miner's fee has been collected by the miner. "
